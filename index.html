					<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>					
Hello. We are a new pop group and are enthusiastic about getting our music careers underway. Ever since we were young we have wanted to pursue our dream of being a popular band. This is because we want to be able show the world our many talents.
<br><br>
We are located in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. And are currently students at the prestigious John Hampden Grammar school. We love our town as it is filled to the brim with the many things we use as inspiration for our songs. As soon as we finish our education we wish to move out into the real world and straight into the music industry.
<br><br>
In our band we have an interesting mix of people: sporty people, clever people, charismatic people and above all: people who want to have fun. I think that with these people we can be a truly great band as we have a mix of different people and this means that we can get a variety of music rather than churning out clones of our original songs.
<br><br>
Overall we are enthusiastic about releasing our song and are excited for you to give us feedback.
<br><br>
Thanks for reading!
